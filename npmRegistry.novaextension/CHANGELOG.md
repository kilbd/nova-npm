## Version 1.1.0

### Improved

- Uses snippets to suggest the latest version of a selected package name completion. Press **Enter** to accept the version suggestion.
- In addition to tags, you can get version completion suggestions by starting to type the major version number.

### Fixed

- Because it now uses a snippet, the long-standing issue where the preceding space caused version suggestions to not appear should be fixed.

## Version 1.0.1

### New

- Gained permission to use the official npm logo.

## Version 1.0.0

### Initial release

- Completions for names and versions of packages in the npm public registry
